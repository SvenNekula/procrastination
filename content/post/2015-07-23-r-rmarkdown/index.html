<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Sven Nekula, I’m 23 years old and I graduated from the Friedrich-Alexander-
University in the summer of 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Sociology.
Since November 2020 I’ve been studying Survey Statistics at the Otto-Friedrich-University in Bamberg.
The first time I came into contact with statistics was in the third semester of my
bachelor studies. I quickly realized, that I enjoyed statistics the most out of all
my classes and thus decided to attend more and more classes that dealt with statistics.
In the fourth semester I took classes that taught the use of SPSS and R and I’ve worked
with R ever since. In my fifth and sixth semester I came across GitHub and rmarkdown
and created two small websites that you can see on my GitHub profile.</p>
