<div id="who-am-i" class="section level1">
<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Sven Nekula, I’m 23 years old and I graduated from the Friedrich-Alexander-
University in the summer of 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Sociology.
Since November 2020 I’ve been studying Survey Statistics at the Otto-Friedrich-University in Bamberg.
The first time I came into contact with statistics was in the third semester of my
bachelor studies. I quickly realized, that I enjoyed statistics the most out of all
my classes and thus decided to attend more and more classes that dealt with statistics.
In the fourth semester I took classes that taught the use of SPSS and R and I’ve worked
with R ever since. In my fifth and sixth semester I came across GitHub and rmarkdown
and created two small websites that you can see on my GitHub profile.</p>

<div id="why-did-i-create-this-blog" class="section level1">
<h1>Why did I create this blog?</h1>
<p>I created this blog for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>to further develope my skills with R, GitHub and whatever else I’m going to be using
down the line</li>
<li>to be accountable and learn more by doing</li>
<li>and finally to ‘productively procrastinate’ as Rebecca Barter put it in her <a href="http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-02-03_blogger/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="what-will-i-post-here" class="section level1">
<h1>What will I post here?</h1>
<p>I will post different projects on here. Those will range from personal projects to university
tasks. I’m also really interested in learning more about machine learning, so expect a
machine learning project soon.</p>

<div id="some-more-words" class="section level1">
<h1>Some more Words…</h1>
<p>Even though I’ll try to post here weekly, I can’t promise that it will always be the case.
Especially during february-march resp. july-august I’m probably swamped due to university
assignments and exams, but I will try my best.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or just want to hang out, follow / hit me up on
twitter :)</p>
<p>I think that’s all I have to say right now. See you next time! -SN</p>
