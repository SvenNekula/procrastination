# Intro

Hello again. Unfortunately it took longer than I had anticipated to create another
post. I've spent a lot of time lately trying to set up Ubuntu on my desktop PC to use
features like GPU-accelerated tensorflow etc. 

I'm trying my best at image recognition with R, but I need some more time.
Sorry to keep you waiting, I'll push it as soon as I figured everything out. 

SORRY!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#loading packages
if(!require(keras)){
    install.packages("keras")
    library(keras)
}

if(!require(EBImage)){
    install.packages("EBImage")
    library(EBImage)
}
```
