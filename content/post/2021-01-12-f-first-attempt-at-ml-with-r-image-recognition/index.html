<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Hello again. Unfortunately it took longer than I had anticipated to create another
post. I’ve spent a lot of time lately trying to set up Ubuntu on my desktop PC to use
features like GPU-accelerated tensorflow etc.</p>
<p>I’m trying my best at image recognition with R, but I need some more time.
Sorry to keep you waiting, I’ll push it as soon as I figured everything out.</p>
<p>SORRY!</p>
